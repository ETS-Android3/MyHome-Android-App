# Contributing

Follow these steps to get started:

1. Fork the repository
2. Take a look at the issues if you need some inspiration.
3. Start programming some (new) methods and/or classes.
4. Create a pull request & wait :)

**Important note**
- For authorized users, DO NOT CREATE PULL REQUESTS, WHICH ARE NOT YOUR OWN

Before submitting, make sure you wrote some tests. Javadoc is nice to have.

## Style Guidelines

- Write your code as readable as possible
  - Curly brackets like {
    } this
  - Structured code
  - Use the existing code as an example
- Also, Lambdas are cool and welcome
